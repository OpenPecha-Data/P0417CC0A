Verses of Auspiciousness
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

sangye nyima jikten sum du sal
With the sun of the Buddha illuminating the three worlds,
damchö dawé sipé rimné sel
The moon of Dharma dispelling the malady of conditioned existence,
gendün norbü ö kyi sateng khyab
And the jewelled light of the Saṅgha flooding the entire earth—
chok sum rinchen dampé tashi shok
May the auspiciousness of the precious Three Jewels abound!

lamé tashi jinlab trinpung trik
Through the auspicious guru, blessings gather like billowing clouds,
yidam tashi ngödrub drangchar beb
Through the auspicious yidam deity, siddhis descend like gentle rain,
khandrö tashi lé shyi nyéma min
Through the auspicious ḍākinī, grains of the four activities ripen—
tsa sum rabjam gyatsö tashi shok
May the auspiciousness of infinite, oceanic Three Roots abound!

chökü tashi tongchen ying kyi khar
The auspiciousness of dharmakāya is great emptiness, the sky of basic space,
longkü tashi tsenpé metok tra
In which the auspiciousness of sambhogakāya is radiant with the blossoming signs and marks,
tulkü tashi khordé chiryang trö
And the auspiciousness of nirmāṇakāya emanates throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa according to what
is required—
ku sum shyingkham gyatsö tashi shok
May the auspiciousness of the infinite Three Kāya realms abound!

tsepakmé gön gangri lhünpo la
When the great snow mountain of the protector Amitāyus
pakmé tukjé dawé khyüpa la
Is embraced by the compassionate moon of noble Tārā
nampar gyalmé tashi nangwa gyé
The auspicious light of Vijayā expands and shines forth—
chimé tselha sum gyi tashi shok
May the auspiciousness of the three deities of deathless life abound!
