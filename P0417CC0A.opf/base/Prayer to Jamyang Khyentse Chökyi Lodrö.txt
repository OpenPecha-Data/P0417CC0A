om swasti
Oṃ svasti.
gyal kün khyenpé yeshe ter chenpo
A great treasury of the knowing wisdom of all the victorious ones
jamyang lama khyen dang tsewé wang
Was the Mañjughoṣa guru with the power of knowledge and love.1
dé yi trinlé namrol trulpé ku
And you are the nirmāṇakāya emanation of his enlightened activity—
lodrö gyatsö shyab la solwa deb
Lodrö Gyatso, at your feet I pray.

gönpo chok gi sang sum yündu ten
May the three secrets of this supreme protector long remain secure,
kyé dang tserab küntu jezung né
May he guide and care for me in all my births and lives to come
tek chok sung gi dütsi tsowa dang
And sustain me with nectar-like teachings on the supreme vehicle,
jinlab yeshe nying la jukpar shok
And may his blessings and primordial wisdom infuse my heart.

Written by the master himself in response to requests, supported by gifts, from Serdrup Dungsé
